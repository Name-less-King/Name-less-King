### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My research interest mainly lies in financial engineering, especially financial risk management.

Iâ€™m currently working on sparse covariance regression model with [Prof. Xuening Zhu](https://xueningzhu.github.io/).

I will be studying for my Ph.D. degree at Fudan University, and my supervisor is [Prof. L. Jeff Hong](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=stZYMd8AAAAJ&hl=en).
